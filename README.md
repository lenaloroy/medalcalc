A fairer way of grading the olympics

Clone the Repository
If you havenâ€™t already, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>

Then, navigate into the project directory:
cd <repository-folder>

Navigate to the src Directory
Your Java source files are in the src folder, so move there:
cd src

Compile the Java Files
Since you have multiple Java files, compile them together:
javac Olympics.java Country.java

This generates .class files for each Java source file.

Run the Program
Once compiled, run the main class:
java Olympics
